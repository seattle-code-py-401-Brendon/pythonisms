### Setup
`.env` requirements (where applicable)

**i.e.**

- `PORT` - Port Number
- `DATABASE_URL` - URL to the running Postgres instance/db
#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)
- e.g. `python main.py`

## Findings
- this is a modification to stack class, this adds a method that will reverse a string, after doing the code challenge the other day, I thought a built in method to reverse a string using a stack would make python life simpler. this method takes in a string, pushes each item in the string onto a stack and then pops it into a new string and returns the new reversed string. 

#### How to use your library (where applicable)
#### Tests
- How do you run tests?
- Any tests of note?
